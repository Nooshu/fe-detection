# ðŸš¨ðŸš¨DeprecatedðŸš¨ðŸš¨

This repo has now been deprecated since the Design System team has now added the `:root {--govuk-frontend-version: "[version number]";}` into their CSS files. See [issue 2](https://github.com/Nooshu/fe-detection/issues/2) for more information!

# GOV.UK Frontend Detection
Bash script to try to find what version of GOV.UK Frontend is being used on a service. Point the script at a services CSS file to guess the version used.

Example command:
```
./bin/fe-test.sh -u https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/v4.3.0/dist/govuk-frontend-4.3.0.min.css
```

## Use on a live services
Running the following command:
```
./bin/fe-test.sh -u https://create-energy-label.service.gov.uk/assets/static/css/main.css
```
Gives the following output:

```
âœ“ 1.0.0 present
âœ“ 1.1.0 present
âœ“ 1.2.0 present
âœ“ 1.3.0 present
âœ“ 2.0.0 present
âœ“ 2.1.0 present
âœ“ 2.2.0 present
âœ“ 2.5.0 present
âœ“ 2.6.0 present
âœ“ 2.7.0 present
âœ“ 2.9.0 present
âœ“ 2.10.0 present
âœ“ 2.11.0 present
âœ“ 3.0.0 present
âœ“ 3.1.0 present
âœ“ 3.3.0 present
âœ“ 3.6.0 present
âœ“ 3.7.0 present
âœ“ 3.8.0 present
âœ“ 3.9.0 present
âœ“ 3.10.0 present
âœ“ 3.11.0 present
```

So version `3.11.0` of GOV.UK Frontend is most likely being used on this service.

## Use on a CSS file
Some services restrict the downloading of assets via `curl`, so you can download via the browser then pass them into the script using the `-f` flag:

```
./bin/fe-test.sh -f css-filename.css
```

## Methodology
The 'dist` version of the CSS it taken and differences between versions are identified, then used to pin down a particular version of GOV.UK Frontend being used. Use the following command to do this:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/v4.3.0/dist/govuk-frontend-4.3.0.min.css | cssbeautify-cli -s > ./css/govuk-frontend-4.3.0.css
```

## Generating diffs
For future reference it is possible to generate file diffs using git with the following command:
```
./generate-diffs.sh
```

## Caveats
This is always going to be an approximate version test. If all services were using the `dist` version of the CSS it would be easy. But as service teams can pick / choose certain components to include in their build process. So at some point they may not include CSS that is being used to pin down a particular version.

# Testing
Tests written using Bats: Bash Automated Testing System. Run using the `bats fe-test.bats` command.

Depends on:

- [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/)
- [cssbeautify-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cssbeautify-cli)
- [Bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats)

# To add a new version of GOV.UK Frontend
```
# Download and beautify the css
# e.g. curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/v4.3.0/dist/govuk-frontend-4.3.0.min.css | cssbeautify-cli -s > ./css/govuk-frontend-4.3.0.css
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/v[VERSION]/dist/govuk-frontend-[VERSION].min.css | cssbeautify-cli -s > ./css/govuk-frontend-[VERSION].css

# generate the new diffs
./generate-diffs.sh

# Examine the new version diff looking for a unique change for this version
# Add version + unique change to `fe-test.sh`
# Add new test to `fe-test.bats` and run test
bats ./bin/fe-test.bats
```
